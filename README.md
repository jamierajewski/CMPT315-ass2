# CMPT315-ass2

Full-stack single page app that allows students to provide feedback on their peers for presentations.

Back-end written in Go and PostgreSQL.
Front-end written in Typescript and doT for templating.

Included is a .http file to test each REST API route. Sprinkled throughout the code are comments on things I would have liked 
to have done better given more time (as this was a school project and my first foray into web development).

Please excuse my poor committing practices; they have since become far better since I graduated!
